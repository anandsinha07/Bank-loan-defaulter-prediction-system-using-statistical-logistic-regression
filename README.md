# Bank-loan-defaulter-prediction-system-using-statistical-logistic-regression

Bank Loan defaulter Predictor is a system designed to remove Bad debts from Bank loan Provision. Bad Debts are normally due to disbursement of loans to customer who look good on paper, or the loan evaluation officer misses out on certain flags and hence passes the loan. By using Statistical Logistic Regression trained to determine these bad debts on past data with financial and non financial input vectors, we can reject potential bad customers or flag and monitor already provisioned high risk loans so that bad debts can be predicted in advance and hence do not get converted into Non Performing Assets. 

Python modules are deployed on Django app to develop a full fledged system for Bank Official.
